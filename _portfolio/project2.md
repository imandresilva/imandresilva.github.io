The Astraeus mission is responsible for finding planets suitable for mining operations. You will embark on an
atmospheric journey to the depths of a planet to learn the grim fate of the previous colonising crew. You will be faced
with increasingly difficult challenges, as you delve deeper into the twisting caves.

Will you be able to manage your resources long enough to reach the next resupply point, or fail and never know what
happened to Astraeus 42?
