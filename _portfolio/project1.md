This game was developed as a part of my Master's thesis, which proposes a conceptual framework for designing and
comparing hint systems as a core piece of user centered design. The game applies this conceptual framework by allowing
the players to choose between two different types if hint selection: Random, and Covert->Overt.

**Goal**
Every round you will have an objective to find and pick up. If you are successful in picking up the objective in the
available time, a new round will start with a new objective. If not, a new round will start but the objective will stay
the same.

**Score**
Your score is represented by a bar at the top of the screen. Every time you successfully complete a round, the score bar
will move towards the right. If you fail to complete your objective, the bar will move towards the left. Reach the right
or the left and win or lose the game, respectively.
